# Eat-a-Burger!
A burger-centered full-stack application built using Express, Express-Handlebars and a homemade ORM

## Description
This application allows users to create, devour, and delete burgers. Using multiple API routes, the application sends GET, PUT, and DELETE requests to an Express.js server hosting a remote database on Heroku.

With some static CSS and JavaScript, this app will seamlessly interact with a model and a controller to display dynamic content based on user interaction.
